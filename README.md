A technical test for Android development.

## Introduction:

First off, thanks for taking the time to apply to our organization. We really apporeciate the interest, and we know your time is valuable. We hope that this test will give you a little insight into some of the technologies and systems we deal with on an everyday basis, in addition to helping us get a better idea of your strengths and how what you can bring to our team.

Just keep in mind, that like most programming problems, there is rarely a single right or wrong answer. Do the work to the best of your abilities. If there is a section or part you are uncertain of, make an assumption and be sure to document it in the solution you provide. We're not here to try and trick you.

Good luck!
