# Our Test Server

The test server we will be using for this exercise is located [here](http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/). It contains a bunch of test healthcare data put there by various people testing thier FHIR applications. Just as a warning though, this is not a production server, so any data stored on it could be wiped at any time. Do not depend on this server for permanent storage, and keep in mind that someone else could modify or delete your data without warning.

On the left side of the page, you will see a list of the various FHIR resources stored on the server. For our demo application, we are concerned with the [Patient](http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/resource?serverId=home_21&pretty=false&resource=Patient) link.

On the patient page, hit the 'Search' button. The page will reload, and you will see a whole bunch of information.
